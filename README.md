![Swagger UI](./src/main/resources/static/images/personal-library-manager.png)

üëã Welcome to Readiction

Your reading companion that will make the reading journey much easier. An idea that came up to me when I found myself using a highlighter to highlight any quote
that I like, and also when I found out that I'm using another external app to capture any new word that I don't know what it means.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Registration:** Registering the user by creating a new account and sending him a 6-digit verification code.
- **Logging In:** The user can enter the 6-digit verification code to verify his new account and receive the JWT.
- **Adding New Book:** After logging in, the user can add the information of any new book that he has bought.
- **Updating the Book Info:** The user can also change the book info, like the status, to keep track his reading journey.
- **Adding quotes:** While reading, the user can add any quote (and its page number) that he finds interesting, so that it will be associated to the book he is
  reading.
- **Adding new words:** The user can also add any new word with its translation and related sentence (English to Arabic).
